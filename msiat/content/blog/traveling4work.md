##### Ask; Or the answer is always no

I am on the way home from my _very first Work trip_.
How exciting it was to have even had the opportunity.

I have been an in intern for 10 months on my first internship.
In a standard weekly, my project lead and another team member were discussing the on-site. She, the team member, asks me if I was to attend. This being the first time hearing of it, my response is negative and she suggests going to speak with our manager.
It felt weird asking my manager about being able to attend the meeting. It feels weird asking her for anything at all. She is very quick and speedy and my questions register to me as a form of slowing her down. She says **yes**.

After following along with the surprisingly up to date documentation, to learn about booking and travel, and then having selected an expensive flight, a cozy hotel and good sized rental car, an ace-wrap of doubt surrounded me.

- Why would they spend this money on me?
- What business do I have attending this meeting?
- What is my presence actually going to do?

In trying to unbind myself, the manager agreed to meet with me for a quick 5 mints at my request. This time, listening with the part of me that once was excited to go, she said that it would be good experience, a great chance to meet other team members and also visit the new location. She adds that people are the most expensive check we have around here and you getting to learn and be trained is the best use of of funds.

##### Work Day 1/2

_30 minutes early._
The building is made of glass. It is nice and the kind that one who loves space would like to work in. Standing in the lobby of the meeting building, with my only moments old printed visitor badge, I watched as a complete separate group of people meeting de-bus and packed themselves into another room. The badge proving to me that I too, am meant to be here. Once the the lobby settled, a man walks from nowhere and sits on the couch. I walk and sit next to him and ask is he with the group. After confirming yes, I introduce myself to him and he me. I realize I already know who he his. I have been hearing his name since my first meeting on this project back in May '24. Asking his last name, real casual like, he confirms he is who I thought and we chat a bit further. His leaving the company at the end of the week is the reason we have all come to this meeting in the first place. I tell him I have been hearing his name for almost a year and what a pleasure it is to meet him. He, up until now has probably only ever heard of me or seen my name on some git PR's. Not too soon and before I could become too excitingly silly, another member approaches and I am shown to the meeting room and leaving PI to welcome others in.

In this room, 3 sides made of glass, is a conference table and chairs, coffee, muffins and additional chairs that line the wall. Most of the conference table seats unclaimed, that ace-wrap feeling returns to me. In response, I sit in a chair along the wall, set my things down and leave so as not to disturb what I called 'the real people' (the people who had a reason to be there). Looking around this corner and that, there was only some many places i could like and only one place I should be and with that, I return to the conference room and my things. Another unknown man, looks at me and waves me over to the table. Me and that ace-wrap point to myself and mouth 'me' with a questioning face, and very tempted to look behind me but knows there is only a wall. I smile as he nods up-down and I move to the seat beside him. Introductions are made, I am the only intern, and the meeting carries on. Questions I had were asked first by others to the group. More time passes and the ace-wrap turns into a comfortable nothing-ness, falls away from me, and I begin to feel that I belong. I am another developer who is here because I work on this project the same way they all do.

##### Work Day 2/2

_10 Minutes early_ Today is a different room, a larger amount of people and this time, there are not enough seats for everyone at the conference table and with a squeak of the chair, the doubt creeps up around me and am taunted by my thoughts over and over, of the idea that someone else should have my seat. In this moment I am no longer a developer but a seat taker. Today, with a new agenda, and my questions of yesterday asked but not answered, i was cycling my mind and things to ask. Good interns to that right? The default resolution to this for me is to come up with 'W' questions; who what... I find a 'Why' question and proceed to share it. Context of the question left in the room, asking it leads to about an hour long conversation of others piggybacking on. A home-run of a question if you ask me!

Through out this day, I watched the PI to get to know him more. I watched his face as attendees made it cringe or shake in disagreement. He knew that some things said were the wrong way to move forward. He intervened when it was necessary and other times it seemed he had to let things and the next decisions be left for the continuing party to fix the problems that began here. He knew his time was over, yet, even on his way out, he was courteous and loving to the project that he carried.

{{< fas laptop fa-1x fa-fade >}} With more for me to want to talk to him a bout, asking him for a moment to chat later in the day, this last day, was easy. Quickly scribbling down the question after searching my brain for content I had hoped he would find profound.

> Having been apart of this project since the beginning, where have you recognized a gap in development that an intern would find good work in doing that would make her a better developer.

He answered and said that it indeed was a good question. Our conversation was long for an impromtu break time. He suggested creating a blog as he told me about his own.

And with that, Hello World!

As the agenda items finish, the group concludes itself. The after chat commences. He then hands me a [book](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/probabilistic-data-structures-and-algorithms-for-big-data-applications-andrii-gakhov/1130581752;jsessionid=14180ADC862FAF9487553ABB83F8BFCF.prodny_store02-atgap13?ean=9783748190486). YES! A book. Wow. how cool! This developer sees the developer in me. Sitting in thee now almost emppty room, reading the back, flipping the pages, I think i should get him to sign it only to flip once more and see that he had already done so. He writes to never stop learning and wishes me luck in all my efforts.

##### Filing the memories away

My feet are kicked up on my carry-on suitcase in the airport terminal as the pieces of this experience lattice together. Exploring his blog just a bit after pulling it up on my phone, I see a post that begins to hint on his reasons for leaving.



I hope to be like that. Gracious to my team on a a project that I let push me right out the door. I hope to be true to my career goals and wanting to be my smartest self. Solve problems.
Keynote speaking. He has done all that want to do.

The Greys Anatomy song plays gently in there airport speakers. The one Dr. Hunt sings. [Chasing Cars](https://genius.com/Snow-patrol-chasing-cars-lyrics). This is the song that should play as the soundtrack to his post. For the only reason being that in his words it seems he forgot his world; All in his efforts to do his passion. To be a problem solver. To be the best developer and the smartest version of himself he had ever been.

```
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world? {{< fas music fa-1x >}}
```

I felt in reading it that I do not want to code. I stand to graduate in 5 Weeks with a MS in CS Concentration Cybersecurity. I love programming and problem solving. But I struggle now in thinking I am done with it. With more reflection and as the song carries on, I see that i canâ€™t forget my world. My goal in this field has always been to get myself to the smartest most capable version of myself that I can. With the lyrics fading out, resolve grows stronger. I notice it was fear of failure conflated with passion that happened. It is instead the case that I want to be like him. I hope to one day write an email that says I believe i am one of if not the strongest developer in the department; as he did. I am scared that I may not get there but I can try. To be scared but not let it prevent me trying is the goal for this task. I should try and make mistakes. I should try and get red errors and have my terminal scream at me. I should try and break my code that the only way around it is to start over. And then do start over. Again.
